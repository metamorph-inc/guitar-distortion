# guitar-distortion
A variation on the Big Muff™ guitar distortion

## Format
This model uses the Metamorphosys toolset for Windows desktop PCs.

## Notes
A tone control is usually included in Big Muff™ designs, but I prefer the sound you get from bypassing that part of the circuit. This variation skips the tone section entirely.

Volume is also not provided. The output is pegged at what would be the maximum volume setting. Spinal Tap style.
